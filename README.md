# SQL_Employee_Tracker

 

## Description
For this project we were to make a SQL page that allowed an employer to track the employees in a database. You should be able to add new departments, new roles and new employees. This project was heavily focused on getting the SQL to work properly in the terminal and to appear for the user. A video example has been added to the bottom of this page to help lead you through the page.
